This ex11 will be tailored to fit Raspberry Pi, however most linux distributions will do if you replace the apt-get command with the corresponding one for your distribution.

Sometimes, when you don't need a full fledged window manager but just want to display a sensor value or a couple of push buttons and a slider on a 5" screen, then try this all erlang graphics X11 library for your raspberry pi erlang project. You get soft realtime animations. Concurrency between 2 or more widgets on screen. Custom widgets, show what you can draw. Lots of free DXF graphics and symbol libraries on the internet to download and convert to ex11 with the included dxf2erl utility.

To help create new widgets there is a small program in util to convert DXF-files to erlang ex11 drawing primitives. Download or draw your own graphics in a CAD system and save as DXF. Convert the DXF file with dxf2erl:start("filename.dxf"). from the erlang console. There is a sample DXF file in util as well as a demo widget made up from the clock.dxf file. You can even load the clock.dxf file into a CAD system and change, scale and rotate the graphics and save it into a new DXF file.

The DXF file can be created in QCAD (free) http://www.ribbonsoft.com/en/ , AUTOCAD and other CAD systems. Entities with higher thickness will be drawn last. Closed polylines will be filled areas in ex11.


Install with a fresh Raspbian (even Light will do). If you already have xserver and erlang installed, skip those steps:
# Erlang
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
wget http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_18.2.1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf otp_src_18.2.1.tar.gz
cd otp_src_18.2.1/
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo rm -R otp_src_18.2.1/

# xserver
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
sudo Xorg -s 0 dpms &
(press enter and you will get the command prompt back)

# ex11
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/skvamme/ex11.git
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
xauth
add :0 . ab12cd34ef56fe78dc90ba1a2b3c4d5e6f
(If there is any chance your system could be hacked, replace at least one of the random characters above)
exit
cd ex11
make



Compile util with:
erlc -I ../lib *.erl

Start util with:
erl -noshell -pa '../lib' -s clock init
